## Campaign monitor test


### Test Notes

I chose GoLang to solve the first 4 requirements.
The reason for choosing it is that Go is simple to read & understand, has great integrated unit testing, it's extremely fast & there's a lot of community support

**Requirement 1:** <br />
Please note that Go doesn't have a NULL value. It has a nil value, but it is used in a slightly different way than what is expected in the requirement, which is why i only tested the string length
